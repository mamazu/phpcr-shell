Reloads the current session.

If the <info>--keep-changes</info> option is not given then this command discards
all pending changes currently recorded in this Session and returns all items to
reflect the current saved state.

If <info>keep-changes</info> is true then pending change are not discarded but
items that do not have changes pending have their state refreshed to reflect
the current saved state, thus revealing changes made by other sessions.
